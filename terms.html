    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 21 February 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the DuoVox application ("App") provided by David Arthur Software ("DAS", "we", "our", "us"). By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>DuoVox is a real-time voice transcription and translation application. The App captures audio, transcribes speech to text, and provides AI-powered translations between supported languages. The App is available on Android and Windows platforms.</p>

    <h2>2. Subscription Tiers</h2>
    <p>The App offers the following tiers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free:</strong> On-device transcription. AI translation is available by watching a short rewarded advertisement, which unlocks translation for a limited period.</li>
        <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Full AI transcription with ad-gated translation (one advertisement per day unlocks 24 hours of AI translation).</li>
        <li><strong>Premium:</strong> Full AI transcription and translation with no advertisements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subscription pricing is displayed within the App and on the Google Play Store. Subscriptions are billed through Google Play and are subject to Google Play's terms and refund policies.</p>

    <h2>3. Account and API Key Usage</h2>
    <p>Premium and Standard features require an active internet connection and access to cloud-based AI services. If you provide your own API key for third-party services, you are responsible for any usage charges incurred on your account with that provider. DAS is not responsible for charges on third-party accounts.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes. You must not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the App to record conversations without the consent of all parties, where required by applicable law</li>
        <li>Use the App in any way that violates applicable local, national, or international law</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or extract the source code of the App</li>
        <li>Redistribute, sublicense, or resell the App or any part of it</li>
        <li>Use the App to generate content that is harmful, abusive, or violates the rights of others</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
    <p>Transcription and translation are provided by AI services and are <strong>not guaranteed to be accurate</strong>. The App is intended as a communication aid and should not be relied upon for legal, medical, safety-critical or official translation purposes. DAS makes no warranty as to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any transcription or translation output.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its code, design, icons, and documentation, is the intellectual property of David Arthur Software. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the App for personal or business purposes in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App relies on third-party services for AI processing and advertising. These services have their own terms and privacy policies. DAS is not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or conduct of third-party services. Service interruptions by third-party providers may affect App functionality.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. DAS does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, DAS shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>

        <li>Unauthorised access to or alteration of your data</li>
        <li>Any third-party service interruption or failure</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, all locally stored data remains on your device until you delete it.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
