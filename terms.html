    <h1 data-i18n="terms.title">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated" data-i18n="terms.updated">Last updated: 22 February 2026</p>

    <p data-i18n="terms.intro">These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the DuoVox application ("App") provided by David Arthur Software ("DAS", "we", "our", "us"). By installing or using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="terms.s1.title">1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p data-i18n="terms.s1.p1">DuoVox is a real-time voice transcription and translation application. The App captures audio, transcribes speech to text, and provides AI-powered translations between supported languages. The App is available on Android and Windows platforms.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="terms.s2.title">2. Subscription Tiers</h2>
    <p data-i18n="terms.s2.intro">The App offers the following tiers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-i18n-html="terms.s2.free"><strong>Free:</strong> On-device transcription using local speech recognition. Offline translation can be unlocked temporarily by watching a short video.</li>
        <li data-i18n-html="terms.s2.essential"><strong>Essential ($25/month):</strong> AI transcription and translation using our Economy AI engine. Includes 30 hours of AI usage per month. Additional usage beyond the included hours is available on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
        <li data-i18n-html="terms.s2.premium"><strong>Premium ($65/month):</strong> High Quality AI transcription and translation for improved accuracy. Includes 40 hours of AI usage per month. Includes subtitle export (SRT and VTT formats) and file translation. Additional usage beyond the included hours is available on a pay-as-you-go basis.</li>
        <li data-i18n-html="terms.s2.business"><strong>Business ($250/month):</strong> All Premium features with unlimited usage (subject to a fair-use policy of 200 hours per month). Priority support. Designed for professional, legal, medical and media environments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p data-i18n="terms.s2.billing">All paid tiers are available with annual billing at a discounted rate (equivalent to two months free). Prices shown are approximate in USD; actual pricing is displayed in your local currency within the App and on the Google Play Store. Subscriptions are billed through Google Play and are subject to Google Play's terms and refund policies.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="terms.s2a.title">2a. Usage Limits and Overage</h2>
    <p data-i18n="terms.s2a.p1">Essential and Premium tiers include a set number of AI usage hours per billing cycle. Usage is measured as wall-clock time while AI transcription sessions are active. When you approach your limit, the App will notify you at 80% and 100% of your included hours. Beyond the included hours, you may continue using AI features at the per-minute overage rate for your tier. Unused hours do not carry over to the next billing cycle.</p>

    <h2 data-i18n="terms.s3.title">3. Internet and Cloud Services</h2>
    <p data-i18n="terms.s3.p1">Paid tier features require an active internet connection and access to cloud-based AI services.
