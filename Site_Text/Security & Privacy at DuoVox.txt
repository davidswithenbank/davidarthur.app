Security & Privacy at DuoVox
Your conversations deserve the highest level of protection. DuoVox is built with a privacy‑first architecture that gives users control over their data.

Zero‑Retention Private Mode
When Private Mode is enabled:
• 	Audio is processed in real time
• 	No recordings or transcripts are stored
• 	No data is logged or retained
• 	No information is used for analytics or model training
• 	No third‑party services receive your audio
This mode is ideal for interpreters, healthcare professionals, legal teams, and anyone handling sensitive information.

Standard Mode (Cloud Processing)
When Private Mode is not enabled:
• 	Audio may be processed through secure cloud services
• 	Data may be temporarily cached for performance
• 	No data is sold or shared with advertisers
• 	Users may delete stored transcripts at any time

Data Handling Principles
DuoVox follows these core principles:
• 	Minimal data collection
• 	No unnecessary retention
• 	No sale of user data
• 	No advertising‑based profiling
• 	Clear, transparent communication

Compliance Transparency
DuoVox is designed with strong privacy protections, but:
• 	DuoVox is not HIPAA certified

• 	Organizations are responsible for determining whether DuoVox fits their compliance needs
This ensures clarity and avoids misleading claims.

Security Practices

• 	Regular security reviews and updates
• 	Strict access controls

You can:
• 	Enable Private Mode at any time
