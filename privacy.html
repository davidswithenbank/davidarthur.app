    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 21 February 2026</p>

    <p>David Arthur Software ("DAS", "we", "our", "us") operates the DuoVox application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and protect your information when you use our App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Audio Data:</strong> The App captures audio from your device's microphone or internal audio (speaker output) for real-time transcription. Audio is streamed directly to the transcription service and is <strong>not stored</strong> on our servers or on your device beyond the active session.</p>
    <p><strong>Transcription and Translation Text:</strong> Transcribed and translated text is displayed in the App during your session. This data is held in device memory only and is cleared when you clear the session or close the App. Text is not transmitted to DAS servers.</p>
    <p><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you provide your own API key for third-party AI services, it is stored locally on your device in encrypted storage. It is never transmitted to DAS and is only used to communicate with the relevant AI service provider.</p>
    <p><strong>Preferences and Settings:</strong> Your app settings (selected language, theme, audio source, subscription tier) are stored locally on your device. They are not transmitted to any server.</p>
    <p><strong>Diagnostic Logs:</strong> If you enable diagnostics, log files are stored locally on your device. You may choose to share these with us for support purposes, but they are never collected automatically.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Service Providers:</strong> Audio data is streamed to third-party AI services for transcription, and text may be sent to AI services for translation. These providers process data under their own privacy policies and terms. Data submitted via API is not used to train AI models under current provider policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For users on the Free and Standard tiers, we display rewarded video advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad personalisation. You can manage ad personalisation in your device's Google settings. Google's privacy policy is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Billing:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed through Google Play. Payment information is handled entirely by Google and is never accessed by DAS.</li>
        <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> The offline transcription feature runs entirely on your device using locally installed speech recognition models. No audio or text data leaves your device when using this feature.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect, store or transmit your audio recordings</li>
        <li>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email or phone number (unless you contact us for support)</li>
        <li>We do not track your location</li>
        <li>We do not sell any data to third parties</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking SDKs beyond what Google AdMob requires</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All user data (settings, API keys, diagnostic logs) is stored locally on your device. API keys are encrypted using the platform's secure storage mechanism (Android Keystore). We do not operate servers that store user data.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Clear all session data at any time using the Clear button</li>
        <li>Delete your API key from the App settings</li>
        <li>Delete diagnostic logs from your device storage</li>
        <li>Uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
